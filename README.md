"# Real-Time-Facial-Recognition-System" 

So, our project aims to build a real-time facial recognition application using a state of the art neural network architecture called Siamese Neural Networks. This type of neural nertwork first calculates a numerical embedding of the image captured in realtime (through a webcam, or mobile device) and an anchor image (against which this iamge is compared) and uses some dissimilarity measure to find how similar or dissimilar the images are. The project would involve considerable use of TensorFlow and would give the mentees, a hands on apporach in constructing performant data pipelines, and advanced Tensorflow features like creating custom layers etc.

There will be three datasets : 1. Anchor 2.Positive and 3.Negative Anchor and Positive Datasets will be user generated and below is the link for Negative Dataset https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/
